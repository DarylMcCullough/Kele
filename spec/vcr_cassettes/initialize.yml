        has been in programming (in C++, Java, and Lisp). I am taking the Bloc Software
        Developer track in order to bring my coding skills up to date in modern web
        development tools and languages. Hopefully, this will lead to a new successful
        phase in my career.\n\nI am probably about the oldest student that Bloc has
        ever had--58. I am hoping that my training here leads to another 10 years
        or so of satisfying work for me, before retiring.\n\nSome personal information:
        I have four children, all adopted, of various ethnic background. They are
        all nearing adulthood (the youngest is 18). I''ve lived in Ithaca, New York
        for most of adult life, although I grew up in the South (in Rome, Georgia).","photo_file_name":"13690794_10208662758518422_299342847606852910_n.jpg","photo_content_type":"image/jpeg","photo_file_size":9056,"photo_updated_at":"2016-10-03T14:02:31.844-05:00","send_new_message_emails":true,"referred_by_id":null,"slug":"daryl-mccullough","os":"Windows","last_seen_at":"2017-05-30T16:15:16.979-05:00","private_profile":false,"google_plus_id":null,"linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/daryl-mccullough-99323023","quota":0,"old_first_visit_id":null,"selected_enrollment_chain_id":5436,"phone_num":"(607)
